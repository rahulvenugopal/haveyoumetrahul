Greetings from my little corner of the cosmos. I&rsquo;m a 34-year-old human who now resides in Bengaluru, India. I&rsquo;m working towards the completion of a PhD in neuroscience from the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS. My life has been quite exciting, and the path has been somewhat stormy, in my opinion (and I loved that). I transitioned from the engineering world to the study of the brain and the psyche. For fun, I engage in a variety of orthogonal activities. Fortunately, through time and effort, I was able to make a meaningful and satisfying connection between those random dots. I enjoy where science, technology, and human excitement converge</p>
<p>I like developing things that benefit and improve human life as well as teaching, learning from, and mentoring others. I like to read, travel, go hiking, and eat well. I find the idea of &ldquo;deep work&rdquo; to be really intriguing. A skill that facilitates rapid learning and the production of high-quality outcomes under pressure. Working deeply raises performance and provides the actual satisfaction that comes from craftsmanship</p>

<p>Inspiration to pen this post came from <a href="https://stonecharioteer.com/posts/2021/personal-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Stonecharioteer&rsquo;s blog</a>. I came across this philosophical question somewhere in <code>2010</code> when I was in a limbo after completing my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in engineering. Finally, the time has arrived to write about my values. Do you have a personal code of honour?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not your job, you&rsquo;re not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You&rsquo;re not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.” ~ Fight Club</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am a simple human being who also happens to be a neuroscientist (5th year of PhD) with average intellect, high curiosity &amp; enthusiasm, a teacher at heart, loves (reading/discussing books, travelling, good food), open science enthusiast, tech lover and atheist</p>
<p>Irrespective of my preoccupations or circumstances, I root for some values that define me and constantly remind me of my personal journey on this planet. First and foremost, I loathe bullies and those who intentionally inject inferiority into others. I have tolerated and even been good friends with half a dozen of such people. Part of that came from my meek personality and my respect for their intellectual and technical prowess. I used to have these two wolves fighting in my head, and I am happy that the empathetic one won over. Once the light bulb went on, I slowly started cutting off such people from my life. Life is really short, and it takes an emotional toll on me to be unassertive. I am still working on this skill and I think I am getting better. The other part of this value comes from the fact that I love teaching</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is me taking control — from Sloan, from the Fraternity, from Janice, from billing reports, from ergonomic keyboards, from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best-friends. This is me taking back control — of my life. What the fuck have you done lately?&quot; ~from film Wanted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My parents were teachers, my family members were teachers, my grandfather was the founder of a school, and I had inspiring teachers (my seniors in my research lab) in my life (less than half a dozen though). I think I inherited my teaching gene and associated values with that. Being a great teacher and mentor demands an arsenal of values and discipline. Priority is always given to the student. What I think is the best might not be the best for my mentee or student. I need to be mindful of students&rsquo; insecurities, learning curves, life situations, priorities, etc. A great teacher inspires. In my own personal life, I have suffered enough blows to my mental well-being and career growth because of such horrible bosses. The goal is to dodge such people and never be like them. A great teacher should also entertain the possibility (reality) that students can be smarter than their teachers. Students are collaborators, not competitors. I find joy when my students write better code than me or come from a better place than mine. I aspire to be a mirror to my students, someone they can trust, bounce off their thoughts, and see them for what they are rather than what they are not</p>
<p>I no longer track titles or keep track of my followers, likes, or citations. To prove my worth, I still need two or three significant victories in my life. This portion of me is attempting to quench or put out some former personal disaster. This is where I get my life&rsquo;s speed from. The drawback is that when I wake up, my chest feels heavier. I must quickly get rid of it</p>
<p>I believe in inclusiveness, especially with respect to gender, race, religion, and culture. I hate power games and hierarchies, which are oppressive. I also believe in creating a safe environment around me in my limited capacity. I trust science and its self-correcting nature. I also believe science and technology, in proper hands, can solve a lot of issues in the current world</p>
<p>Finally, I do acknowledge that I was lucky to be born to my parents with a twin sister. I will never forget the care and support from three of my best friends from engineering days. I will never forget those depressing days of crisis (financial, health, and family) where I felt extremely lonely, which shaped me. I will never forget when I got 5/100 in mathematics in class 12 and how my sister tutored me to 73/100. The days I failed in job interviews; the days I secured top ranks in entrance exams; the day I scored rank 4, the same day I dreaded death; the day I resigned my first job; the previous day I walked for two hours at midnight through the streets of Bengaluru with swollen eyes pondering about my career ahead; the day I cried my heart out in the rain in 2010. I cherish the evening I proposed to the love of my life and the day she told me YES. I remember the day I joined as a research scholar in neuroscience. I remember the days when I wrote excellent code. I remember the days I spent hiking in Dehradun with my friends. I remember all the dogs I met and the book &ldquo;Call of the Wild&rdquo; by Jack London. I remember how emotional I was after finishing the Harry Potter series. I remember the shivering when I first read about black holes in class 8. I remember my first win in a maths quiz by a large margin (flawless victory). I do remember almost all my days (good, bad and ugly). I remember reading <code>Da Vinci Code</code> on a wooden bench. I remember downloading transcripts of Matrix trilogy and almost by hearting all the lines</p>
<p>I will forget all the extra baggage I used to carry (primarily from my shitty decisions, attitude at that time point, and random noise). I aspire to be at my best, which I think is still to come. I will continue to teach till my body holds its fort against entropy in the world. I was a happy kid and lost my happiness for a very long period. Around 2011, I recovered it, and ever since then, I have been pleased. I want to be content and at peace all the time</p>
<p>Over all these years in this planet, I have glimpsed my Zen 😇</p>
