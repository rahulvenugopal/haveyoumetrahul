#### Who am I?
Greetings from my little corner of the cosmos. I am an engineer, neuroscientist and mental health professional holding masters in the three disciplines all from top three institutes in the country (India). As a neuroscientist with over a decade of expertise, I specialised in the domains of cognition, neuromodulation, meditation, mind-body interactions and sleep & dreaming. I have guided small teams through the conceptualisation and execution of cutting-edge brain computer interfaces, cognitive profile development, sleep stability assessments, real time neuro feedback systems and AI based models for health analytics. My expertise and passion are at the convergence of wearable technology, neuroscience, productivity, artificial intelligence and proactive solutions for physical and mental health and well being. I am actively seeking opportunities to build a tribe dedicated to crafting innovative, personalised and scalable solutions in this space.

- Be the team who is going to build the core engine which fuels the company for the next 10 years
- Fast work cycles

#### What am I `not` looking for?
