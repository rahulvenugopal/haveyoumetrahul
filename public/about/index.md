# Do you think that's air you're breathing now?


Hey, Hope you are having a good day.

I am working as a `Cognitive Scientist` at the Centre for Consciousness
Studies, NIMHANS, India. I am an engineer turned neuroscientist.
I am a mentor and an engineer at heart who loves technology,
neuroscience in general, and non-ordinary states of consciousness in
particular. I have a non-linear career trajectory with respect to my
career and my life in general. I have a decade plus experience in the
research areas of `Working Memory`, `Neuromodulation`,
`Advanced biosignals analysis`, `Meditation Research` and `Sleep`. I like learning in general, reading, good food, travel once in a while
to see the changes in the world. Recently, I have picked up interest
in physical fitness.

I am establishing a research niche on **Sense of Self** exploring how
it emerges, fragments, and can be altered in various states like
schizophrenia, autism, lucid dreaming etc. This work integrates
neuroscience, psychiatry, technology, and contemplative science
to understand the shifts of selfhood and their impact on mental health.
I have shifted to an agnost from an atheist recently
(primarily as a side effect of Consciousness research).
I do care about the way science is done and loathe the impact
factor and pseudo-prestige in academia. I believe in flat hieracrhy,
  open science and no subtle -isms. I am a sucker for deep work and I value mental health, relations and values. I like working with people who are self driven, with growth mindset, reflective and collaborative.

If you are someone with a similar thought process and/or want to work with me, please send an email to me at rhlvenugopal@gmail.com.

I had lots of fun, learnt a lot and made great friends at
[BAMB2024](https://www.bambschool.org/),
[MESEC 2024](https://mesec.co/event/workshop_2024) and
