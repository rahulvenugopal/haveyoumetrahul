# Mentees


Below are the brave souls (past and present) who have undergone the
`Wax On, Wax Off` journey with me. Each of them has not only mastered the science
but also survived my `Jack of all, Master of None` approach to supervision -
a path that involves a heavy dose of rigorous discussion and the occasional
hour-long tangential journey through science, life, and stories.

##### [Sriya Veerapaneni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriyav) `2021` PhD candidate at UT Southwestern Medical Center, US `(1st Intern at CCS)`

Sriya obtained her integrated bachelor’s and master’s degree in Biological
Sciences from the IIT, Madras. 

For my undergraduate studies, I majored in Biological Sciences at IIT Madras.
Through coursework and research projects at IIT Madras and CCS at NIMHANS,
I built a strong foundation in computational biology and cancer research.
I currently work on projects that integrate computer vision and tissue image
analysis to study pathology in rectal cancer.

*Sriya explored aperiodic components of EEG from Vipassana meditators and
created computationaly efficient batch pipeline for the same during her time at
CCS. She also worked on the automation of slow wave extraction from EEG data
using YASA module.*

##### [Kankana Bhowmick ]() `2025` BS-MS IISER Mohali

I graduated from IISER Mohali with a BS-MS degree in biological sciences.
Although I had no initial experience in coding or data sciences,
I found my passion in physiological data analysis of various kinds through my
internship at CCS. I have also gone on to work on heart data (HRV) synchrony
analysis for my Master's thesis at Universität Konstanz in collaboration with
Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour. I worked as Research
assistant at IIT Jodhpur, Cognitive Engineering Lab under Dr. Dipanjan Roy.

`Rahul is one of the people who made me fall in love with my subject
for which I'm forever grateful 🙂`


*Kankana did a first observership at CCS picking up basics of neurophysiology,
EEG acquisition and analysis, sleep and polysomnography. She came for a second
internship where she worked on EEG correlates of Working Memory,
effects of tACS on working memory performance and learning EEG analysis*

##### [Nandani Kundal ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandani-kundal-a2164227b) `2022` BS-MS, IISER Mohali 
Master's Thesis student at the Centre for Brain Research, IISc  

Nandani was a BS-MS student at IISER Mohali. Her major interests lie in
Neuroscience, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 

*Nandani Investigated aperiodic brain activity in sleep in Vipassana Meditators
using FOOOF toolbox*

##### [Neetu M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neetu--m) `2024` Project staff in Dept. of Psychiatry, NIMHANS

Neetu has interests in analytics, microstates in EEG.

*Neetu did her masters dissertation on EEG Microstates, Schizophrenia and
Polysomnography*

##### [Deepshik Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepshiksharma/) `2025` B.Tech CSE

Deepshik has major interest in maching learning, from Bhutan.

*Deepshik spent days around Tobii Eyetracker and built Python frameworks
to run eye tracking experiments with PyGame and generate heatmaps of gaze. He
teamed up with Siddharth to deepen brain age index project*

##### [Siddharth Rajesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-rajesh-744b811b7/) `2025` BSc Neuroscience & Psychology graduate 

Siddharth is a partial Engineer and
switched to Neuroscience and an aspiring Neurophilopher. While he pursued
Neuroscience in his bachelors, he see himself as a philosopher at heart. His
core drive for philosophy and a deeper sense of curiosity comes from his
pursuit of truth. Truth of the self, the universe, and everything between
and beyond (if there is one).

*Siddharth is understanding **Brain Age Index** from TUH big dataset and 
building ML/DL models to better predict brain age from EEG data*

##### [Manasa Marthala](linkedin.com/in/manasa-marthala) `2025` MSc. Neuropsychology student at CHRIST University

Manasa is a neuropsychology student looking to build stronger hands-on
experience with EEG and research methods. Her interests span how people think,
perceive, and make decisions when interacting with technology, and how tools
like AI can help reveal subtle patterns in behaviour and brain signals.

*Manasa is exploring the Heart-Brain Interactions from EEG data collected during
 working memory paradigm*
