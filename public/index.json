A staycation at Vythiri resort was in bucket list since our marriage. We started from Bengaluru via the scenic Gundalpet, Bandipur route and reached the town of Vythiri just when the sun started its ascent amidst the mist. The entire place seemed super fresh and green from a recent water wash. We had an early check-in around 8 AM and freshen up and was ready for breakfast. The place felt like a portal to another world. We saw someone from the nearest rung of the evolutionary ladder playing hide and seek with us. Monkeys roam around freely and the cottages are monkey-proofed The charming hanging wooden bridge that spanned a vibrant natural waterfall and a river was our gateway to the nature’s womb. Homely spread of Kerala cuisine and a bunch of friendly smiling faces welcomed us to the restaurant. We knew we had to top up our fuel tank to a full tank for the upcoming resort tour We planned our Day 1 atop the tree house and Day 2 in a cottage heaven. It was raining cats and dogs. Our tree house wa literally nestled inside the forest. The sound of the forest was scary and the waterfall sound amplified the rain sound. The walls were of glass so that we don’t miss the view from tree top. It was cosy inside and it was beyond words to describe the experience.

This is a collection of threads that would be valuable for anyone interested in gathering well-rounded opinions around this preprint. I’m hoping that the flame wars will encourage researchers to rethink their approaches Anil Seth IIT can and should be critiqued, but this letter, despite many admirable signatories (\u0026 colleagues/friends) is disappointing. The accusation of pseudoscience is serious \u0026 clickbaity \u0026 IMO the letter doesn’t justify it IIT can generate counterintuitive and (with difficulty) testable predictions, has potential explanatory power, so - despite being odd - seems like science. The media fluff, while unfortunate, is irrelevant to this distinction I do worry that this letter will be read by some as theory-policing by appeal to authority, which would be a shame since it will entrench positions and detract from the debate about (all) theories of consciousness that needs to be had I also worry that some people may take it as a reason/excuse to dismiss IIT without figuring out what they think of it themselves, which would also be a shame. IIT is a bit bonkers, but it is a brave attempt to say something genuinely new There’s also room for many ideas under the IIT remit like weak IIT, which avoids many of the problems attending strong IIT, while making different (though weaker) claims. Read The strength of weak integrated information theory FWIW here’s my take on the @ArcCogitate adversarial collaboration between IIT and GNW, in Nautilus magazine. Progress is being made, even though core claims are not tested One example is that the distinction between inactive and inactivated neurons can make a difference to consciouness. A striking, hard to test, prediction. (Also, IIT is not a computational theory in the sense that Searle argues against) Hakwan lau but Anil, if all u want is for ppl to think for themselves, why does your opinion here matter? of coz expert opinion in the public matters. this is what our statement is about, as stated: to rectify the untruthful promotion. it was not meant to be a review of scientific debate Johannes Kleiner 100 Authors against Einstein: A Look in the Rearview Mirror On being the subject of a media cycle First, IIT clearly isn’t pseudoscience. Anyone who thinks this has probably not engaged thoroughly with IIT’s mathematics. There are lots of problems, but also lots of very important ideas. IIT isn’t just metaphysics Second, while the criticism of the media coverage is fair, it has nothing to do with the title. The title is attention-grabbing of the worst kind. It won’t lead to better science or more thorough coverage. It certainly won’t lead by example Third, I think this is hurtful to the field as a whole. It is super important to be critical about each other’s work, but pushing opinionated criticism of this sort into the public sphere will likely lead to depreciation of the field as a whole Think about the main message to the public: Something they have heard related to consciousness was pseudoscience after all. The majority won’t get what you want to say Renzo Lanfranco 1/8 IIT proposes any system that implements certain computations could be conscious. While IIT opens the door for panpsychism (that consciousness may be a property of the universe, hence allowing all entities to exhibit awareness), the main issue here is IIT’s untestability 2/8 In order for a theory to be considered scientific, its core assumptions and predictions must be falsifiable (testable).

Deep diving to know why\rLet us look at what happens to the ECG data once it enters the pipeline. Stop 1: ecg_clean Default method to clean ECG is neurokit Check for any nan in the data and returns missing datapoints If there are gaps, they are filled with last available value (forward filling method) There is a high pass filter set at 0.5 Hz butterworth filter (order = 5), followed by a powerline filtering (By default, powerline = 50) Stop 2: ecg_peaks Default method to identify peaks is neurokit QRS complexes are detected based on the steepness of the absolute gradient of the ECG signal. Subsequently, R-peaks are detected as local maxima in the QRS complexes. Refer this paper for details In short Compute the ECG gradient to detect rapid changes in slope (rate of change) Take absolute values of gradient so that we don’t miss out negative going waves Smooth the absolute gradient to reduce noise using one tenth of a second long boxcar kernel One more level of smoothing using 75 percent of a second long kernel. This would be ultra smooth 3.Set a dynamic threshold to identify QRS complexes using the double smooth signal. The threshold is set at 1.5 times the smooth curve optimised for finding peaks Detect QRS start and end points based on threshold crossing Filter out short QRS complexes that are likely noise The values are set at one third of a second Find the most prominent peak within each QRS complex. This happens via the locmax[np.argmax(props[\"prominences\"])]. locmax sees only peaks and not troughs This is really critical for R peak detection. If our ECG waveform is flipped (R peaks pointing down), the algorithm would pick the S peak (falling end of R) instead of the peak! See the final comparisons Apply a refractory period to prevent false detections. Once a peak is detected for identified QRS complex, it compares its proximity to previously identified peak of previous QRS complex. If it is within one third of a second, the current peak is dropped.

The average intercept and slope act like a center of gravity, pulling values parameter estimates towards it. Hmm, maybe gravity is not quite the right analogy, because the pull is greater for more extreme values. The lines near that center point are very short; they get adjusted very little. The lines in general get longer as we move away from the complete pooling estimate Douglas Bates (The wizard who wrote the THE book) says somewhere in his lme4 package vignette that shrinkage is the process via estimates for individual subjects “borrow strength” from each other Ahhh, the mandatory books links.

You can become better at finger tricks by practicing Decrease your last layer time (to about 25 seconds or less). You can do this by improving your recognition and execution for each case (to do this you must practice) Try to reduce pauses. Try to never stop turning during your solve. This can be done by practicing a lot! Work on the cross. Try to do the cross in 12 moves or less, and under 12 seconds. Here is a link that will help you achieve/learn this (and then practice it a lot) http://cubefreak.net/speed/cfop/cross.php 🔗 Practice - The more you practice, the faster you’ll become 🐢 ➡️ 🐰 Once you get a little used to the beginner method, you can also try inserting the first layer/side corners from different angles.

Commonly referred to as an institution fellowship. To get this, you must pass both an exam and an interview. The hardest entry is this one. MCQ questions from the field of specific department are frequently found on entrance exams. Path 2: Having one’s own external fellowship (UGC, CSIR, ICMR, etc.) is the second option. For admission to a PhD program, one may apply twice in one year. You must first meet the faculty members and determine whether you can collaborate with one of them on an agreed-upon topic before moving on. Even then, passing exam cutoffs and an interview are requirements for admission. Path 3: By way of research initiatives. A funded project can be joined as a JRF/SRF, and after passing an internal qualifying exam, the applicant will be admitted to a PhD programme. This is a simple method, but you must ensure that the project has sufficient money (minimum three years) and the support of the principal investigator. The research project’s goals can be discussed and included in your PhD objectives. There will be less room to develop your own ideas because research programmes already have defined hypotheses. The three routes are listed in decreasing order of admissions difficulty PS: Thanks to an institute fellowship, I began my PhD at the department of Neurophysiology.

My MPhil was in Neurosciences, and I’m currently completing on my PhD in Neurophysiology Almost every academic and scientific event taking place on campus is open to students. Many students don’t look into these possibilities. Some of them include mortality seminars, brain-cutting sessions, seminars, workshops, colloquia, journal and seminar clubs. Make sure that these activities don’t conflict with the course’s schedules. Plan in advance Students in the neurosciences are listed for monthly rotations in different departments. (Genetics, Neurochemistry, Pathology, Virology, Biophysics, Biostatistics, Neurophysiology, Neuropathology etc.) There will be a coordinator for each department. Although there is a sizable syllabus, topics might be added in response to requests. The schedule is incredibly flexible. This programme’s objective is to introduce students coming from diverse academic backgrounds to the many branches of neuroscience. The Neurosciences course has a wide scope. During the MPhil, one should actively research any questions they may have. Consider your MPhil course as your PhD’s litmus exam. You may pick up a lot of resources that would be useful for your PhD Meeting and interacting with PhD candidates and other departmental researchers is required for students to have an understanding of the numerous research projects being carried out in the lab. Observing and learning about research as they are conducting their studies is a very wonderful concept. Ask the scientists to let you know when they conduct their experiments. The timing is quite flexible. Don’t anticipate a programme that runs exactly on time. Learning actively through interactions is the course’s main goal. Attend as many departmental events as you can. Inform each faculty member of your academic background and research interests when you meet them. Faculty members were really helpful to me and taught the very basics so that I could follow along. (I came with zero neuroscience background from Engineering field) Many people have lamented the absence of a set schedule, and I have also heard this. When students come from such various backgrounds and there is just one year to finish rotation in eight areas, one cannot expect such a format! Every month, we are required to turn in assignments, give a seminar on a certain subject, and do an internal evaluation. Prepare to embrace your busy schedule. Get resources by meeting with seniors. Ask your professors for recommendations on books, powerpoints, or articles. I promise you’ll pick up a lot of knowledge quickly The programme starts with a few introductory lectures that are spread out across several months. You will visit each lab during a rotation and spend a week or so watching the researchers at work. Peer to peer instruction is used. One seminar and one journal review are held each week. This is fairly demanding and calls for careful planning. Students are required to go above what is covered in the textbook when presenting. Consult the appropriate lab teams when getting ready Although the official hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM, one can stay late to learn. A dedicated space for MPhil Neurosciences is available at the NRC building around-the-clock and has a computer and a white board. For the first year, I used to reside there. On request, you can use the printer Departments of epidemiology and biostatistics used to hold a lot of workshops. Being a student also gives one the option to use contingencies or request permission to attend the courses for free. MPhil students receive INR 15,000 in addition to their stipend each year The department of neurophysiology uses a variety of methods, including cell culture, biochemistry, behavioural research, patch and electrophysiological rigs, stereoscopy, microscopy, EEG, and others.

Coursework and training in animal handling and research start in the second month and last for about three months Doctoral students are placed in various labs during this time. They go to one seminar and one journal club meeting each week. Students are free to participate in additional teaching sessions held for MPhils. Each professor used to teach two or three sessions in their area of expertise. The curriculum is flexible, and students must be interested in investigating the opportunities that are available The range of the coursework is extensive. It covers statistics, research technique, computer applications, behavioural science, and basic science. This is an opportunity for new graduate students without any research background to comprehend various subdomains. Research-experienced students can take advantage of this time to brush up on their fundamentals while also speaking with potential mentors. Students want to do a literature review after choosing a research subject or topic and guidance. Some analytical skills which are specific to research area might not be taught at coursework It’s time to transform into a proper lab animal from this point forward. To plan out your PhD study, you concentrate on earlier research done in the lab that is now your lab and consult with mentors and friends. Following the first seeding of the draught idea, there are numerous rounds of debates and revisions before each candidate presents the proposed PhD study to their own lab and then to the department faculty. After doing all of this, you submit your PhD work for approval to the appropriate committee In the meanwhile, it is possible to determine the specifics, potential limitations, and other aspects of the study. After the study has received preliminary permission, we must get ethics approval. PhD work starts as soon as the study is approved by the institute ethics committee We must submit progress reports to the doctorate committee every six months, and we must also present our progress to external and internal examiners once a year. This is a fantastic chance to expedite work and receive input from outside the lab. Every month, one or more PhD students present their research to the department as a whole. Another chance to offer constructive criticism and comments is presented here Pre-PhD tests start showing up in about 18 months. There are two papers with a total of 100 marks each (in a digital tablet, no paper exam). Some faculties conduct mock exams to help pupils truly prepare. To get advice and support, it is wise to speak with seniors from the same lab who have similar PhD specialties. You can become a doctor after passing Pre-PhD! To learn and share their research with the whole research community, students are encouraged to participate in international conferences or seminars.

I am here to guide and support you, but I want you to take ownership of your work. Work on what you are passionate about, work hard, and be proud of it. The most rewarding experiences will come from the problems you solve yourself. See if the project inspires you. Since, the projects are primarily ideated inside my head it would be super interesting to be, but ultra boring for you. Be honest and let me know your opinion. I appreciate that. For example: Simulating Conway’s Game of Life is still ubercool and meaningful to me whereas someone might consider that utter waste of time (How dare you!). I have lots of side projects which are done to quench the wanderer inside me. Part of this is coming from my personal philosphy that science should be fun and not always meant to solve a problem (applied science). It is quite difficult to think through potential applications of something which can seem trivial. I keep thinking about discovery of Pencilin. In 1928, Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming returned to his laboratory at St. Mary’s Hospital in London after a summer vacation. He noticed that one of his petri dishes, which contained Staphylococcus bacteria, had been contaminated with a mold. This particular mold was later identified as Penicillium notatum. Fleming observed that the area immediately surrounding the mold was free of bacteria. This observation was a happy accident. Despite this remarkable finding, Fleming himself didn’t fully realize the discovery’s full potential. He named the active substance “penicillin” but found it was unstable and difficult to produce in large quantities. He published his findings in a scientific paper in 1929, but the medical community largely ignored it. It was seen as more of a laboratory curiosity than a practical treatment. Fleming’s main focus was on his research on staphylococci, and he considered the penicillin mold just an interesting side note. The true potential of penicillin was rediscovered and developed more than a decade later by a team of scientists at the University of Oxford. In the early 1940s, led by Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, they were searching for natural antimicrobial agents. They came across Fleming’s 1929 paper and began to work on purifying and stabilizing penicillin. Their work was driven by the urgent need for treatments for battlefield injuries during World War II.

The details matter. Scientists have to be careful. Don’t rush your work. Think about it. Implement it. Double and triple-check it. Incorporate sanity checks. Ask others to look at your code or data regardless of what you think about yourself. Your primary goal is to learn, read papers, take online courses, ask questions - lots of them and work. Schedule time for deep work and focused learning. Communicate Proactively. Keep me updated on your progress, your challenges, and your successes. I can’t help you if I don’t know you are stuck. I do check in on a regular basis. But I don’t micromanage. You are an adult and will be treated like one. We are co-investigators of the mysteries of Consciousness. Drive your project. Set your own deadlines, identify the next steps. When you present your work, you should be the world’s leading expert on that specific topic (embody that, questions are going to fly with that assumption) Be a good lab citizen. Keep common areas tidy. Clean up food waste, crumbs, and spills. Be on time for meetings. Turn off the lights if you are the last one leaving for the day and make sure the door is locked. Mentorship is a two-way street. You have a right to expect certain things from me as your mentor. I make the following promises to you: I Will Support You: I am committed to supporting you scientifically. My goal is more like Morpheus in movie Matrix. I can only show you the path, you have to walk it. I will be Honest with my feedback. I will provide constructive feedback on your work, ideas, experiments and presentations in a timely manner. I Will Be Available. I will have regular one-on-one meetings with you (twice a week). My door will be open for questions, discussions, and brainstorming. You don’t have to knock unless there is another person in the room or I am in a meeting, But, if something is urgent knock thrice and I will get back to you at the earliest possible I will actively look for opportunities to help you grow like presenting at conferences, applying for fellowships, learning new skills and expanding your professional network.

The modern job market is so vast that it would be impossible to locate an ideal career path in a single lifetime. In order to raise best sellers, creators fabricate the bogeyman of the “passion driven world.” Passion is not a long-lost artefact that can be revived with enough blood and sweat. Since careers have expanded so considerably, a substantial portion of it is likely to consist of routine chores. However, there are stretches of one’s professional life that, contrary to popular belief, provide peace, meaning, and joy. The “passion fuel” is very similar to “Ramar petrol.” Yes, I absolutely agree that certain lucky souls have found a profession that is both a calling and a love. Not everyone is lucky enough to have the probability Gods align their nature, upbringing, preferences, and reality with a single professional path that opens up to them at an young age. What if you haven’t investigated a wide range of professions and career pathways to determine which one you enjoy the most? It seems questionable to me to devote one’s entire working life to a single career. Where did such a distinctive concept come from?Unfortunately, not everyone works out in establishing fulfilling employment that pays well. It doesn’t seem inappropriate to me to have three things that each supply three or more of the aforementioned things (peace, purpose and pay). Maybe you’ll learn more, maybe you won’t. Experience teaches you wisdom regardless of the outcome. You can gain new perspective by conversing with people who seem to be riding passionate horses. I was trying to figure out if your horse and their horse were the same. How closely does your horse’s diet resemble theirs? What if your mount is a mule or a unicorn rather than a horse? Have you ever thought about it? Create a suitable professional persona for yourself. Where should I go to acquire a PhD in neuroscience, in your opinion? How would you align your resources (financial, intellectual, etc.) with your goal if I were to mention a specific UK laboratory? Ask yourself if you have the time and resources to work on that for the next three years. When you complete your PhD, where do you see your life going? Does earning a PhD bring you any closer to your objectives? I’d rather that you ask me which PhD would be best for the facts of your case. Do you mend your parachute after jumping out of an aeroplane? If I have to figure it out later, what do you mean? Building a successful profession takes a lot of self-discipline and forces you to confront unpleasant situations head-on. In those grottoes, I’m sure you can find a certain sparkles. Six factors have the greatest impact on how a career gets crafted: Work ethics Ability to be laser-focused and get to the root of a problem quickly and efficiently Empathetic communication skills Ability to ignore nonsense and have the guts to stop a bad situation in its tracks Bootstraped and self generated happiness The headspace to accept and make peace with one’s decisions. There are no “best” options, only “optimal” ones. Optimal ones may fail and that is totally fine A melancholy-looking man, he had the appearance of one who has searched for the leak in life’s gas-pipe with a lighted candle.

I am a Cognitive Scientist at the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS, and an engineer-turned-neuroscientist. With over a decade of experience across working memory neuromodulation meditation and sleep research, my work now focuses on a specific niche: the Sense of Self. I enjoy continuous learning in general, reading, good food, and traveling occasionally to observe the changes in the world. Recently, I have developed an interest in physical fitness and breathwork. I am establishing a research niche around Sense of Self exploring how it emerges with a rich phenomenology and how it fragments in various states such as schizophrenia, autism, depression and lucid dreaming. This work integrates neuroscience, psychiatry, technology, and contemplative science to understand the shifts of selfhood and their impact on mental health. I care deeply about how science is conducted and loathe the obsession with impact factors and pseudo-prestige in academia. I believe in flat hierarchies, open science and the elimination of subtle “-isms”. I am a proponent of deep work and I value mental health, and highly value physical-mental health, relationships, and core values.

Let’s get started. I have no training in neuroscience, but I appreciate the work you perform. I’d like to change careers. What are my options, and what should I do? The grass always seems to be greener on the other side. Before you abandon ship, you might want to do a litmus test. Spend at least three months as an intern learning the ropes of the academic research field. Look up the research facilities focusing on your preferred area of study (human cognitive research, for example). Do you know that until the project funds arrive, the vast majority of Indian research academics go without pay? Some laboratories are downright toxic. Do you consider yourself a self-learner? Find former lab members and have a chat with them. Make your choice. Research topic and mentors are really important, talk to potential mentors before you join. Figure out if their style of mentoring matches your work style. When I found myself in a similar circumstance, I decided to pursue an MPhil in Neurosciences I had two SRF interviews lined up, but decided not to go that route. If I don’t feel like I’m making progress towards mastery of the material and interest drops below 25%, I decided to call it quits. In addition, I told myself not to beat up on myself over the choice, wallow in misery for two weeks, and then try to move on. I transitioned from engineering to Neuroscience and thanks to hell lot of people who made the journey smoother. What to read, what to prepare I used YouTube to watch every one of Robert Sapolsky’s lectures to feel a sense of understanding and start on a confident note. Neuroscience by Dale Purves is a good place to start. Take MCB80x; if you’re able to put in extra time and effort, consider Medical Neurosciences by Dr. Leonard White. I read Instant notes in neuroscience book which was very helpful to get familiar with terminologies. What skillsets were valued in your lab and how can someone pickup some skills even before starting to work in the lab? The ANTS book and videos by Mike Cohen are excellent tools. Signal processing, logic, coding, neurobiology, and interpretation are all brought together in a seamless fashion in this book. If you want to skip the stories and get right to the meat of the matter, Andy Field’s Discovering Statistics using R is a great place to begin. Read through all of the EEGLAB tutorials.

Greetings from my little corner of the cosmos. I’m a 37-year-old human who now resides in Bengaluru, India. I completed a PhD in Cognitive Neurosciences from the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS. My life has been quite exciting, and the path has been somewhat stormy, in my opinion (and I loved that). I transitioned from the engineering world to the study of the brain and the psyche. For fun, I engage in a variety of orthogonal activities. Fortunately, through time and effort, I was able to make a meaningful and satisfying connection between those random dots. I enjoy where science, technology, and human excitement converge. I like building things that benefit and improve personal (and other human/non human life) as well as teaching, self learning and mentoring others. I like to read, travel and eat well. I find the idea of “deep work” to be really intriguing. A skill that facilitates rapid learning and the production of high-quality outcomes under pressure. Working deeply raises performance and provides the actual satisfaction that comes from craftsmanship Values With all the stones life throws at us, find that balance Inspiration to pen this post came from Stonecharioteer’s blog. I came across this philosophical question somewhere in 2010 when I was in a limbo after completing my bachelor’s degree in engineering. Finally, the time has arrived to write about my values. Do you have a personal code of honour? You are not your job, you’re not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You’re not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.” ~ Fight Club I am a simple human being who also happens to be a neuroscientist with average intellect, high curiosity \u0026 enthusiasm, a teacher at heart, loves (reading/discussing books, travelling, good food), open science enthusiast and a tech lover. Irrespective of my preoccupations or circumstances, I root for some values that define me and constantly remind me of my personal journey on this planet. First and foremost, I loathe bullies and those who intentionally inject inferiority into others. I have tolerated and even been a good friend with half a dozen of such people. Part of that came from my non confronting personality and my respect for their intellectual and technical prowess. I used to have these two wolves fighting in my head, and I am happy that the empathetic one won over. Once the light bulb went on, I slowly started cutting off such people from my life. Life is really short, and it takes an emotional toll on me to be unassertive. I am still working on this skill and getting real better. The other part of this value comes from the fact that I love teaching. This is me taking control — from Sloan, from the Fraternity, from Janice, from billing reports, from ergonomic keyboards, from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best-friends. This is me taking back control — of my life. What the fuck have you done lately?\" ~from film Wanted My parents were teachers, my family members were teachers, my grandfather was the founder of a school, and I had inspiring teachers (my seniors in my research lab) in my life (less than half a dozen though). I think I inherited my teaching gene and associated values with that. Being a great teacher and mentor demands an arsenal of values and discipline. Priority is always given to the student. What I think is the best might not be the best for my mentee or student. I need to be mindful of students’ insecurities, learning curves, life situations, priorities, etc. A great teacher inspires. In my own personal life, I have suffered enough blows to my mental well-being and career growth because of such horrible bosses. The goal is to dodge such people and never be like them. A great teacher should also entertain the possibility (reality) that students can be smarter than their teachers. Students are collaborators, not competitors.
