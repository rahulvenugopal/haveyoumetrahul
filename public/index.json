This thread will be a guide to help you get faster at solving the Rubik‚Äôs Cube using the popular Fridrich/CFOP method. Please read this thread and do some forum searching prior to asking questions about becoming faster First off, the most important factor is practice. No matter what method you use, or how many algorithms you know, you need to practice a lot to progress. With practice, you will be able to turn the cube faster, recognize cases ore quickly, and just in general gain a better understanding of the cube. You can even get sub 20 averages with a beginner ‚Äôs method - but only if you practice a lot. No other factor is more important.

Commonly referred to as an institution fellowship. To get this, you must pass both an exam and an interview. The hardest entry is this one. MCQ questions from the field of specific department are frequently found on entrance exams. Path 2: Having one‚Äôs own external fellowship (UGC, CSIR, ICMR, etc.) is the second option. For admission to a PhD program, one may apply twice in one year. You must first meet the faculty members and determine whether you can collaborate with one of them on an agreed-upon topic before moving on. Even then, passing exam cutoffs and an interview are requirements for admission. Path 3: By way of research initiatives. A funded project can be joined as a JRF/SRF, and after passing an internal qualifying exam, the applicant will be admitted to a PhD programme. This is a simple method, but you must ensure that the project has sufficient money (minimum three years) and the support of the principal investigator. The research project‚Äôs goals can be discussed and included in your PhD objectives. There will be less room to develop your own ideas because research programmes already have defined hypotheses. The three routes are listed in decreasing order of admissions difficulty PS: Thanks to an institute fellowship, I began my PhD at the department of Neurophysiology. Since I am ineligible for any CSIR/ICMR fellowships due to my educational background and age, institute fellowship was an alternative for me.

My MPhil was in Neurosciences, and I‚Äôm currently completing on my PhD in Neurophysiology Almost every academic and scientific event taking place on campus is open to students. Many students don‚Äôt look into these possibilities. Some of them include mortality seminars, brain-cutting sessions, seminars, workshops, colloquia, journal and seminar clubs. Make sure that these activities don‚Äôt conflict with the course‚Äôs schedules. Plan in advance Students in the neurosciences are listed for monthly rotations in different departments. (Genetics, Neurochemistry, Pathology, Virology, Biophysics, Biostatistics, Neurophysiology, Neuropathology etc.) There will be a coordinator for each department. Although there is a sizable syllabus, topics might be added in response to requests. The schedule is incredibly flexible. This programme‚Äôs objective is to introduce students coming from diverse academic backgrounds to the many branches of neuroscience. The Neurosciences course has a wide scope. During the MPhil, one should actively research any questions they may have. Consider your MPhil course as your PhD‚Äôs litmus exam. You may pick up a lot of resources that would be useful for your PhD Meeting and interacting with PhD candidates and other departmental researchers is required for students to have an understanding of the numerous research projects being carried out in the lab. Observing and learning about research as they are conducting their studies is a very wonderful concept. Ask the scientists to let you know when they conduct their experiments. The timing is quite flexible. Don‚Äôt anticipate a programme that runs exactly on time. Learning actively through interactions is the course‚Äôs main goal. Attend as many departmental events as you can. Inform each faculty member of your academic background and research interests when you meet them. Faculty members were really helpful to me and taught the very basics so that I could follow along. (I came with zero neuroscience background from Engineering field) Many people have lamented the absence of a set schedule, and I have also heard this. When students come from such various backgrounds and there is just one year to finish rotation in eight areas, one cannot expect such a format! Every month, we are required to turn in assignments, give a seminar on a certain subject, and do an internal evaluation. Prepare to embrace your busy schedule. Get resources by meeting with seniors. Ask your professors for recommendations on books, powerpoints, or articles. I promise you‚Äôll pick up a lot of knowledge quickly The programme starts with a few introductory lectures that are spread out across several months. You will visit each lab during a rotation and spend a week or so watching the researchers at work. Peer to peer instruction is used. One seminar and one journal review are held each week. This is fairly demanding and calls for careful planning. Students are required to go above what is covered in the textbook when presenting. Consult the appropriate lab teams when getting ready Although the official hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM, one can stay late to learn. A dedicated space for MPhil Neurosciences is available at the NRC building around-the-clock and has a computer and a white board. For the first year, I used to reside there. On request, you can use the printer Departments of epidemiology and biostatistics used to hold a lot of workshops. Being a student also gives one the option to use contingencies or request permission to attend the courses for free. MPhil students receive INR 15,000 in addition to their stipend each year The department of neurophysiology uses a variety of methods, including cell culture, biochemistry, behavioural research, patch and electrophysiological rigs, stereoscopy, microscopy, EEG, and others.

Each professor used to teach two or three sessions in their area of expertise. The curriculum is flexible, and students must be interested in investigating the opportunities that are available The range of the coursework is extensive. It covers statistics, research technique, computer applications, behavioural science, and basic science. This is an opportunity for new graduate students without any research background to comprehend various subdomains. Research-experienced students can take advantage of this time to brush up on their fundamentals while also speaking with potential mentors. Students want to do a literature review after choosing a research subject or topic and guidance. Some analytical skills which are specific to research area might not be taught at coursework It‚Äôs time to transform into a proper lab animal from this point forward. To plan out your PhD study, you concentrate on earlier research done in the lab that is now your lab and consult with mentors and friends. Following the first seeding of the draught idea, there are numerous rounds of debates and revisions before each candidate presents the proposed PhD study to their own lab and then to the department faculty. After doing all of this, you submit your PhD work for approval to the appropriate committee In the meanwhile, it is possible to determine the specifics, potential limitations, and other aspects of the study. After the study has received preliminary permission, we must get ethics approval. PhD work starts as soon as the study is approved by the institute ethics committee We must submit progress reports to the doctorate committee every six months, and we must also present our progress to external and internal examiners once a year. This is a fantastic chance to expedite work and receive input from outside the lab. Every month, one or more PhD students present their research to the department as a whole. Another chance to offer constructive criticism and comments is presented here Pre-PhD tests start showing up in about 18 months. There are two papers with a total of 100 marks each (in a digital tablet, no paper exam). Some faculties conduct mock exams to help pupils truly prepare. To get advice and support, it is wise to speak with seniors from the same lab who have similar PhD specialties. You can become a doctor after passing Pre-PhD!

The modern job market is so vast that it would be impossible to locate an ideal career path in a single lifetime. In order to raise best sellers, creators fabricate the bogeyman of the ‚Äúpassion driven world.‚Äù Passion is not a long-lost artefact that can be revived with enough blood and sweat. Since careers have expanded so considerably, a substantial portion of it is likely to consist of routine chores. However, there are stretches of one‚Äôs professional life that, contrary to popular belief, provide peace, meaning, and joy. The ‚Äúpassion fuel‚Äù is very similar to ‚ÄúRamar petrol.‚Äù Yes, I absolutely agree that certain lucky souls have found a profession that is both a calling and a love. Not everyone is lucky enough to have the probability Gods align their nature, upbringing, preferences, and reality with a single professional path that opens up to them at an young age. What if you haven‚Äôt investigated a wide range of professions and career pathways to determine which one you enjoy the most? It seems questionable to me to devote one‚Äôs entire working life to a single career. Where did such a distinctive concept come from?Unfortunately, not everyone works out in establishing fulfilling employment that pays well. It doesn‚Äôt seem inappropriate to me to have three things that each supply three or more of the aforementioned things (peace, purpose and pay). Maybe you‚Äôll learn more, maybe you won‚Äôt. Experience teaches you wisdom regardless of the outcome. You can gain new perspective by conversing with people who seem to be riding passionate horses. I was trying to figure out if your horse and their horse were the same. How closely does your horse‚Äôs diet resemble theirs? What if your mount is a mule or a unicorn rather than a horse? Have you ever thought about it? Create a suitable professional persona for yourself. Where should I go to acquire a PhD in neuroscience, in your opinion? How would you align your resources (financial, intellectual, etc.) with your goal if I were to mention a specific UK laboratory? Ask yourself if you have the time and resources to work on that for the next three years. When you complete your PhD, where do you see your life going? Does earning a PhD bring you any closer to your objectives? I‚Äôd rather that you ask me which PhD would be best for the facts of your case. Do you mend your parachute after jumping out of an aeroplane? If I have to figure it out later, what do you mean? Building a successful profession takes a lot of self-discipline and forces you to confront unpleasant situations head-on. In those grottoes, I‚Äôm sure you can find a certain sparkles. Six factors have the greatest impact on how a career gets crafted: Work ethics Ability to be laser-focused and get to the root of a problem quickly and efficiently Empathetic communication skills Ability to ignore nonsense and have the guts to stop a bad situation in its tracks Bootstraped and self generated happiness The headspace to accept and make peace with one‚Äôs decisions.

Greetings from my little corner of the cosmos. I‚Äôm a 34-year-old human who now resides in Bengaluru, India. I‚Äôm working towards the completion of a PhD in neuroscience from the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS. My life has been quite exciting, and the path has been somewhat stormy, in my opinion (and I loved that). I transitioned from the engineering world to the study of the brain and the psyche. For fun, I engage in a variety of orthogonal activities. Fortunately, through time and effort, I was able to make a meaningful and satisfying connection between those random dots. I enjoy where science, technology, and human excitement converge I like developing things that benefit and improve human life as well as teaching, learning from, and mentoring others. I like to read, travel, go hiking, and eat well. I find the idea of ‚Äúdeep work‚Äù to be really intriguing. A skill that facilitates rapid learning and the production of high-quality outcomes under pressure. Working deeply raises performance and provides the actual satisfaction that comes from craftsmanship Values With all the stones life throws at us, find that balance Inspiration to pen this post came from Stonecharioteer‚Äôs blog. I came across this philosophical question somewhere in 2010 when I was in a limbo after completing my bachelor‚Äôs degree in engineering. Finally, the time has arrived to write about my values. Do you have a personal code of honour? You are not your job, you‚Äôre not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You‚Äôre not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.‚Äù ~ Fight Club I am a simple human being who also happens to be a neuroscientist (5th year of PhD) with average intellect, high curiosity \u0026 enthusiasm, a teacher at heart, loves (reading/discussing books, travelling, good food), open science enthusiast, tech lover and atheist Irrespective of my preoccupations or circumstances, I root for some values that define me and constantly remind me of my personal journey on this planet. First and foremost, I loathe bullies and those who intentionally inject inferiority into others. I have tolerated and even been good friends with half a dozen of such people. Part of that came from my meek personality and my respect for their intellectual and technical prowess. I used to have these two wolves fighting in my head, and I am happy that the empathetic one won over. Once the light bulb went on, I slowly started cutting off such people from my life. Life is really short, and it takes an emotional toll on me to be unassertive. I am still working on this skill and I think I am getting better. The other part of this value comes from the fact that I love teaching This is me taking control ‚Äî from Sloan, from the Fraternity, from Janice, from billing reports, from ergonomic keyboards, from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best-friends. This is me taking back control ‚Äî of my life. What the fuck have you done lately?\" ~from film Wanted My parents were teachers, my family members were teachers, my grandfather was the founder of a school, and I had inspiring teachers (my seniors in my research lab) in my life (less than half a dozen though). I think I inherited my teaching gene and associated values with that. Being a great teacher and mentor demands an arsenal of values and discipline. Priority is always given to the student. What I think is the best might not be the best for my mentee or student. I need to be mindful of students‚Äô insecurities, learning curves, life situations, priorities, etc. A great teacher inspires. In my own personal life, I have suffered enough blows to my mental well-being and career growth because of such horrible bosses. The goal is to dodge such people and never be like them. A great teacher should also entertain the possibility (reality) that students can be smarter than their teachers. Students are collaborators, not competitors","date":"2022-09-04","objectID":"/haveyoumetrahul/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"About me","uri":"/haveyoumetrahul/about/"},{"categories":null,"content":"About LoveIt","date":"2019-08-02","objectID":"/haveyoumetrahul/gallery/","tags":null,"title":"A picture is worth thousand words","uri":"/haveyoumetrahul/gallery/"}]
