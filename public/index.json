Commonly referred to as an institution fellowship. To get this, you must pass both an exam and an interview. The hardest entry is this one. MCQ questions from the field of specific department are frequently found on entrance exams. Path 2: Having one’s own external fellowship (UGC, CSIR, ICMR, etc.) is the second option. For admission to a PhD program, one may apply twice in one year. You must first meet the faculty members and determine whether you can collaborate with one of them on an agreed-upon topic before moving on. Even then, passing exam cutoffs and an interview are requirements for admission. Path 3: By way of research initiatives. A funded project can be joined as a JRF/SRF, and after passing an internal qualifying exam, the applicant will be admitted to a PhD programme. This is a simple method, but you must ensure that the project has sufficient money (minimum three years) and the support of the principal investigator. The research project’s goals can be discussed and included in your PhD objectives. There will be less room to develop your own ideas because research programmes already have defined hypotheses. The three routes are listed in decreasing order of admissions difficulty PS: Thanks to an institute fellowship, I began my PhD at the department of Neurophysiology. Since I am ineligible for any CSIR/ICMR fellowships due to my educational background and age, institute fellowship was an alternative for me.

Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

My MPhil was in Neurosciences, and I’m currently completing on my PhD in Neurophysiology Almost every academic and scientific event taking place on campus is open to students. Many students don’t look into these possibilities. Some of them include mortality seminars, brain-cutting sessions, seminars, workshops, colloquia, journal and seminar clubs. Make sure that these activities don’t conflict with the course’s schedules. Plan in advance Students in the neurosciences are listed for monthly rotations in different departments. (Genetics, Neurochemistry, Pathology, Virology, Biophysics, Biostatistics, Neurophysiology, Neuropathology etc.) There will be a coordinator for each department. Although there is a sizable syllabus, topics might be added in response to requests. The schedule is incredibly flexible. This programme’s objective is to introduce students coming from diverse academic backgrounds to the many branches of neuroscience. The Neurosciences course has a wide scope. During the MPhil, one should actively research any questions they may have. Consider your MPhil course as your PhD’s litmus exam. You may pick up a lot of resources that would be useful for your PhD Meeting and interacting with PhD candidates and other departmental researchers is required for students to have an understanding of the numerous research projects being carried out in the lab. Observing and learning about research as they are conducting their studies is a very wonderful concept. Ask the scientists to let you know when they conduct their experiments. The timing is quite flexible. Don’t anticipate a programme that runs exactly on time. Learning actively through interactions is the course’s main goal. Attend as many departmental events as you can. Inform each faculty member of your academic background and research interests when you meet them. Faculty members were really helpful to me and taught the very basics so that I could follow along. (I came with zero neuroscience background from Engineering field) Many people have lamented the absence of a set schedule, and I have also heard this. When students come from such various backgrounds and there is just one year to finish rotation in eight areas, one cannot expect such a format! Every month, we are required to turn in assignments, give a seminar on a certain subject, and do an internal evaluation. Prepare to embrace your busy schedule. Get resources by meeting with seniors. Ask your professors for recommendations on books, powerpoints, or articles. I promise you’ll pick up a lot of knowledge quickly The programme starts with a few introductory lectures that are spread out across several months. You will visit each lab during a rotation and spend a week or so watching the researchers at work. Peer to peer instruction is used. One seminar and one journal review are held each week. This is fairly demanding and calls for careful planning. Students are required to go above what is covered in the textbook when presenting. Consult the appropriate lab teams when getting ready Although the official hours are from 9 AM to 5 PM, one can stay late to learn. A dedicated space for MPhil Neurosciences is available at the NRC building around-the-clock and has a computer and a white board. For the first year, I used to reside there. On request, you can use the printer Departments of epidemiology and biostatistics used to hold a lot of workshops. Being a student also gives one the option to use contingencies or request permission to attend the courses for free. MPhil students receive INR 15,000 in addition to their stipend each year The department of neurophysiology uses a variety of methods, including cell culture, biochemistry, behavioural research, patch and electrophysiological rigs, stereoscopy, microscopy, EEG, and others. When one completes a PhD, they can learn about these methods and save a tonne of time i","date":"2020-01-05","objectID":"/blog/career/how-is-the-course-1/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"How is the course? Part 1 | MPhil","uri":"/blog/career/how-is-the-course-1/"},{"categories":["Career"],"content":"The first month after students enroll in the course is a habituation month. Coursework and training in animal handling and research start in the second month and last for about three months Doctoral students are placed in various labs during this time. They go to one seminar and one journal club meeting each week. Students are free to participate in additional teaching sessions held for MPhils. Each professor used to teach two or three sessions in their area of expertise. The curriculum is flexible, and students must be interested in investigating the opportunities that are available The range of the coursework is extensive. It covers statistics, research technique, computer applications, behavioural science, and basic science. This is an opportunity for new graduate students without any research background to comprehend various subdomains. Research-experienced students can take advantage of this time to brush up on their fundamentals while also speaking with potential mentors. Students want to do a literature review after choosing a research subject or topic and guidance. Some analytical skills which are specific to research area might not be taught at coursework It’s time to transform into a proper lab animal from this point forward. To plan out your PhD study, you concentrate on earlier research done in the lab that is now your lab and consult with mentors and friends. Following the first seeding of the draught idea, there are numerous rounds of debates and revisions before each candidate presents the proposed PhD study to their own lab and then to the department faculty. After doing all of this, you submit your PhD work for approval to the appropriate committee In the meanwhile, it is possible to determine the specifics, potential limitations, and other aspects of the study. After the study has received preliminary permission, we must get ethics approval. PhD work starts as soon as the study is approved by the institute ethics committee We must submit progress reports to the doctorate committee every six months, and we must also present our progress to external and internal examiners once a year. This is a fantastic chance to expedite work and receive input from outside the lab. Every month, one or more PhD students present their research to the department as a whole. Another chance to offer constructive criticism and comments is presented here Pre-PhD tests start showing up in about 18 months. There are two papers with a total of 100 marks each (in a digital tablet, no paper exam). Some faculties conduct mock exams to help pupils truly prepare. To get advice and support, it is wise to speak with seniors from the same lab who have similar PhD specialties. You can become a doctor after passing Pre-PhD! To learn and share their research with the whole research community, students are encouraged to participate in international conferences or seminars. Based on my own experience, this is a brief overview of what happens at the Neurophysiology department at NIMHANS ","date":"2020-01-06","objectID":"/blog/career/how-is-the-course-2/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"How is the course?

Greetings from my little corner of the cosmos. I’m a 34-year-old human who now resides in Bengaluru, India. I’m working towards the completion of a PhD in neuroscience from the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS. My life has been quite exciting, and the path has been somewhat stormy, in my opinion (and I loved that). I transitioned from the engineering world to the study of the brain and the psyche. For fun, I engage in a variety of orthogonal activities. Fortunately, through time and effort, I was able to make a meaningful and satisfying connection between those random dots. I enjoy where science, technology, and human excitement converge I like developing things that benefit and improve human life as well as teaching, learning from, and mentoring others. I like to read, travel, go hiking, and eat well. I find the idea of “deep work” to be really intriguing. A skill that facilitates rapid learning and the production of high-quality outcomes under pressure. Working deeply raises performance and provides the actual satisfaction that comes from craftsmanship Values With all the stones life throws at us, find that balance Inspiration to pen this post came from Stonecharioteer’s blog. I came across this philosophical question somewhere in 2010 when I was in a limbo after completing my bachelor’s degree in engineering. Finally, the time has arrived to write about my values. Do you have a personal code of honour? You are not your job, you’re not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You’re not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis. You are all singing, all dancing crap of the world.” ~ Fight Club I am a simple human being who also happens to be a neuroscientist (5th year of PhD) with average intellect, high curiosity \u0026 enthusiasm, a teacher at heart, loves (reading/discussing books, travelling, good food), open science enthusiast, tech lover and atheist Irrespective of my preoccupations or circumstances, I root for some values that define me and constantly remind me of my personal journey on this planet. First and foremost, I loathe bullies and those who intentionally inject inferiority into others. I have tolerated and even been good friends with half a dozen of such people. Part of that came from my meek personality and my respect for their intellectual and technical prowess. I used to have these two wolves fighting in my head, and I am happy that the empathetic one won over. Once the light bulb went on, I slowly started cutting off such people from my life. Life is really short, and it takes an emotional toll on me to be unassertive. I am still working on this skill and I think I am getting better. The other part of this value comes from the fact that I love teaching This is me taking control — from Sloan, from the Fraternity, from Janice, from billing reports, from ergonomic keyboards, from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best-friends. This is me taking back control — of my life. What the fuck have you done lately?\" ~from film Wanted My parents were teachers, my family members were teachers, my grandfather was the founder of a school, and I had inspiring teachers (my seniors in my research lab) in my life (less than half a dozen though). I think I inherited my teaching gene and associated values with that. Being a great teacher and mentor demands an arsenal of values and discipline. Priority is always given to the student. What I think is the best might not be the best for my mentee or student. I need to be mindful of students’ insecurities, learning curves, life situations, priorities, etc. A great teacher inspires. In my own personal life, I have suffered enough blows to my mental well-being and career growth because of such horrible bosses. The goal is to dodge such people and never be like them. A great teacher should also entertain the possibility (reality) that students can be smarter than their teachers.
