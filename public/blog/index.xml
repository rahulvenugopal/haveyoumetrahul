      <description>where the rustling leaves üçÉ and flowing waters üåä become your lullaby Vythiri is scenic town in God&amp;rsquo;s own country in the district of Wayanad. A staycation at Vythiri resort was in bucket list since our marriage. We started from Bengaluru via the scenic Gundalpet, Bandipur route and reached the town of Vythiri just when the sun started its ascent amidst the mist. The entire place seemed super fresh and green from a recent water wash.</description>

Path 1: The institute itself funds the three seats in the department (Only some departments have these fellowship seats). Commonly referred to as an institution fellowship.

      <description>MPhil Neurophysiology and MPhil Neuroscience were two distinct courses with two distinct objectives. My MPhil was in Neurosciences, and I&amp;rsquo;m currently completing on my PhD in Neurophysiology
Almost every academic and scientific event taking place on campus is open to students. Many students don&amp;rsquo;t look into these possibilities. Some of them include mortality seminars, brain-cutting sessions, seminars, workshops, colloquia, journal and seminar clubs. Make sure that these activities don&amp;rsquo;t conflict with the course&amp;rsquo;s schedules.</description>

      <description>The opinions of these so-called motivational gurus, passion seekers, and career counsellors on how to define one&amp;rsquo;s career are about as useful as conversations over what colour parachutes are worth. The modern job market is so vast that it would be impossible to locate an ideal career path in a single lifetime. In order to raise best sellers, creators fabricate the bogeyman of the &amp;ldquo;passion driven world.&amp;rdquo;
Passion is not a long-lost artefact that can be revived with enough blood and sweat.</description>

      <description>Who am I? Greetings from my little corner of the cosmos. I&amp;rsquo;m a 35-year-old human who now resides in Bengaluru, India. I&amp;rsquo;m working towards the completion of a PhD in neuroscience from the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS. My life has been quite exciting, and the path has been somewhat stormy, in my opinion (and I loved that). I transitioned from the engineering world to the study of the brain and the psyche.</description>
