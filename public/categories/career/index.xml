Some of them include mortality seminars, brain-cutting sessions, seminars, workshops, colloquia, journal and seminar clubs. Make sure that these activities don&rsquo;t conflict with the course&rsquo;s schedules.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[From Circuits to Consciousness Welcome to my journey so far from the world of electronics and communication engineering to Consciousness research.
I began my career designing logic on circuit boards, only to realise the most complex operating system runs on wetware where there is no clear demarkation of the data, hardware and software. I traded silicon for synapses, and today, as a Cognitive Scientist at the Centre for Consciousness Studies (NIMHANS), my work revolves around multiple states of Consciousness across illness and wellness in wake, sleeping, meditating and dreaming brains.]]></description>
