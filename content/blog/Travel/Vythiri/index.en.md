### where the rustling leaves :leaves: and flowing waters :water_wave: become your lullaby 

Vythiri is scenic town in God's own country in the district of Wayanad. A staycation at `Vythiri resort` was in bucket list since our marriage. We started from Bengaluru via the scenic Gundalpet, Bandipur route and reached the town of Vythiri just when the sun started its ascent amidst the mist. The entire place seemed super fresh and green from a recent water wash.

We had an early check-in around 8 AM and freshen up and was ready for breakfast. The place felt like a portal to another world. We saw someone from the nearest rung of the evolutionary ladder playing hide and seek with us. Monkeys roam around freely and the cottages are monkey-proofed

The charming hanging wooden bridge that spanned a vibrant natural waterfall and a river was our gateway to the nature's womb. Homely spread of Kerala cuisine and a bunch of friendly smiling faces welcomed us to the restaurant. We knew we had to top up our fuel tank to a full tank for the upcoming resort tour

We planned our Day 1 atop the tree house and Day 2 in a cottage heaven. It was raining cats and dogs. Our tree house wa literally nestled inside the forest. The sound of the forest was scary and the waterfall sound amplified the rain sound. The walls were of glass so that we don't miss the view from tree top. It was cosy inside and it was beyond words to describe the experience.
