title: What is the procedure for getting a PhD in NIMHANS? Part 2
weight: 2
---

Visit the NIMHANS website to download the most recent entrance prospectus. To learn more about the eligibility requirements, course duration, costs, stipend, number of seats, etc., read the prospectus

The announcement is made during the first week of January, and is then followed by an entrance exam, an interview, a selection announcement, admission, and the start of the course by July first week

Almost every faculty has a project that is funded by the government or the institution. These programs, which normally last three or five years, feature openings for JRF/SRFs or research associates. These openings are advertised on the NIMHANS website all year long. Monitor this page closely. Project participants who meet the fundamental requirements on the NIMHANS entrance exam can pursue a PhD. Refer to the prospectus once again for complete details. (there is some requirement with respect to course work, limit on minimum months left in project at the time of application etc.)

Some important information for potential students:
1. View NIMHANS faculty pages and lab webpages to learn about the types of research being done at each lab
2. Make contact with PhD candidates who are already enrolled in the department you want to join
3. Compile a list of potential PhD advisors
4. Verify whether such faculties have openings for a PhD student. Unfortunately, faculties are unable to accept one additional student
5. Make an appointment to meet with faculty members to discuss choices and find a match based on your skill set and interests
6 Read some of the lab's most recent publications and be familiar with the methods and resources the lab offers
7. Prepare a research CV (list of your skill set, scholarships, prior research work, publications, reference etc.)
8. Clearly explain why you wish to pursue a PhD in this area. Although a good response, `I am interested in cancer biology and want to develop a cure` is not at all precise. Make an effort to be specific. If you lack past knowledge or are unable to focus on a certain topic, be honest and state that you plan to take a few months to decide what to accomplish particularly while remaining open to discussion and resolution

It would be advantageous if you could pick up some independent laboratory-relevant skills during your preparatory time, like as programming or statistical analysis
