Hey, Hope you are having a good day.

I am a `Cognitive Scientist` at the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS,
and an engineer-turned-neuroscientist. With over a decade of experience across
`working memory` `neuromodulation` `meditation` and `sleep` research,
my work now focuses on a specific niche: **the Sense of Self**.

I enjoy continuous learning in general, reading, good food, and traveling occasionally
to observe the changes in the world. Recently, I have developed an interest in
physical fitness and breathwork.

I am establishing a research niche around **Sense of Self** exploring how
it emerges with a rich phenomenology and how it fragments in various states 
such as schizophrenia, autism, depression and lucid dreaming.
This work integrates neuroscience, psychiatry, technology, and contemplative
science to understand the shifts of selfhood and their impact on mental health.

I care deeply about how science is conducted and loathe the obsession with
impact factors and pseudo-prestige in academia. I believe in flat hierarchies,
open science and the elimination of subtle "-isms".
I am a proponent of [deep work](https://calnewport.com/some-notes-on-deep-working/) and I value mental health,
and highly value physical-mental health, relationships, and core values.
I enjoy working with people who are self driven, possess a growth mindset and
are reflective and collaborative.

If you are someone with a similar thought process and/or want to work with me,
please send an email to me at rhlvenugopal@gmail.com.

I had lots of fun, learnt a lot and made great friends at
[BAMB2024](https://www.bambschool.org/),
[MESEC 2024](https://mesec.co/event/workshop_2024) and
[CIFAR 2024](https://cifar.ca/next-generation/cifar-neuroscience-of-consciousness-winter-school/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=soc&utm_campaign=winterschool22).
