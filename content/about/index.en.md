Hey, Hope you are having a good day.

I am a `Cognitive Scientist` at the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS,
and an engineer-turned-neuroscientist. With over a decade of experience across
`working memory` `neuromodulation` `meditation` and `sleep` research,
my work now focuses on a specific niche: **The Sense of Self**.

 I like learning in general, reading, good food, travel once in a while
to see the changes in the world. Recently, I have picked up interest
in physical fitness and breathwork.

I am establishing a research niche around **Sense of Self** exploring how
it emerges with a rich phenomenology and how it fragments in various states like
Schizophrenia, Autism, Depression, Lucid dreaming etc. This work integrates
neuroscience, psychiatry, technology, and contemplative science
to understand the shifts of selfhood and their impact on mental health.

I do care about the way science is done and loathe the impact factor and
pseudo-prestige in academia. I believe in flat hierarchy, open science and
no subtle -isms. I am a sucker for [deep work](https://calnewport.com/some-notes-on-deep-working/) and I value mental health,
relations and values. I like working with people who are self driven, with
growth mindset, reflective and collaborative.

If you are someone with a similar thought process and/or want to work with me,
please send an email to me at rhlvenugopal@gmail.com.

I had lots of fun, learnt a lot and made great friends at
[BAMB2024](https://www.bambschool.org/),
[MESEC 2024](https://mesec.co/event/workshop_2024) and
[CIFAR 2024](https://cifar.ca/next-generation/cifar-neuroscience-of-consciousness-winter-school/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=soc&utm_campaign=winterschool22).
