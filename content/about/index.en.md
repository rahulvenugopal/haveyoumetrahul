I work at the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS, India. I recently defended my thesis and am currently determining my next career steps before the end of 2024.

I am a jack of all trades and have a non-linear career track. I hold degrees in Electronics and Communication Engineering (BTech), Neuroscience (MPhil and PhD), and Mental Health (PG Diploma). I am a mentor and builder at heart who loves technology, neuroscience in general, and non-ordinary states of consciousness in particular. I have a decade of experience in the research areas of `working memory`, `neural oscillations`, `neuromodulation', 'meditation research`, `cardiac dynamics` and `sleep & dreaming`. I have built communities around edtech, productivity, blogging, and self-growth. I have taught schoolchildren and coached underprivileged people to get jobs; I have also worked as a career counselor, placement officer, and science lead for an early-stage education startup. I have a substantial amount of experience working closely with the founding team of deep tech startups. My expertise and passion are at the intersection of neuroscience, productivity, team building, artificial intelligence, and wearable technology. I am keen on building sustainable and scalable products and solutions for skill development and mental health plus wellbeing.

I am crafting my career in three parts. I am focusing 50% of my career on `Consciousness research`, 25% on developing impactful solutions in the field of `Personal growth and skill development`, and 25% on being `an explorer`. If you are someone with a similar thought process or totally orthogonal to the above, please send an email to me at rhlvenugopal@gmail.com.

I had lots of fun, learnt a lot and made great friends at [BAMB2024](https://www.bambschool.org/), [MESEC 2024](https://mesec.co/event/workshop_2024). I live online [here.](https://rahulvenugopal.github.io/haveyoumetrahul/)
