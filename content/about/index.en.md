`As of 2025`: I work at the Centre for Consciousness Studies, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, India. I am wrapping up couple of research papers from my previous work and exploring broader frameworks to study Consciousness. At this point in time, I am diving deep into Buddhist philosophy of mind and Consciousness and some esoteric practices within some traditions of Vajrayana Buddhism. After attending the **Non-ordinary states of Consciousness** winter school and discussions with Prof Metzinger, I am drawn to the *Minimal Phenomenal Experience* project.

In a parallel dimension, I am building **uMaster** an initiative to solve everything weird and ugly with the current academia-research setup and higher education. Ah, by the way, I am a teacher at heart and really care a lot about the whole mentoring process. Partly, mentoring gives me lots of purpose in life points. I have taught schoolchildren and coached underprivileged people to get jobs; I have also worked as a career counselor, placement officer, and science lead for an early-stage education startup.

I havd a non-linear career track. I did a bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering and wasted four years of my life! I failed at least 3 (out of 6) subjects every semester in all my internal exams and my mom had to visit the college every semsester! Damn. I wrote improvement exams to make up for those failures and ended up with 68% aggregate. Decided to take an year off to patch up my life once for all.

Life turned around for me and I did a masters in Medical Electronics and landed a corporate job in Bengaluru. Got thoroughly bored after an year and resigned the job to pursue a career in Neuroscience. Worked harder to grab a seat for MPhil in Neurosciences at NIMHANS. Was unsure of doing a Phd. So, worked in a project for two years. 

I hold degrees in Electronics and Communication Engineering (BTech), Neuroscience (MPhil and PhD), and Mental Health (PG Diploma). I am a mentor and builder at heart who loves technology, neuroscience in general, and non-ordinary states of consciousness in particular. I have a decade of experience in the research areas of `working memory`, `neural oscillations`, `neuromodulation', 'meditation research`, `cardiac dynamics` and `sleep & dreaming`. I have a substantial amount of experience working closely with the founding team of deep tech startups. My expertise and passion are at the intersection of neuroscience, productivity, team building, artificial intelligence, and wearable technology. I am keen on building sustainable and scalable products and solutions for skill development and mental health plus wellbeing.

I am crafting my career in three parts. I am focusing 50% of my career on `Consciousness research`, 25% on developing impactful solutions in the field of `Personal growth and skill development`, and 25% on being `an explorer`.

I had lots of fun, learnt a lot and made great friends at [BAMB2024](https://www.bambschool.org/), [MESEC 2024](https://mesec.co/event/workshop_2024). I live online [here.](https://rahulvenugopal.github.io/haveyoumetrahul/)
