### From Circuits to Consciousness

Welcome to my journey so far from the world of electronics and communication
engineering to Consciousness research. 

I began my career designing logic on circuit boards, only to realise the most
complex operating system runs on wetware where there is no clear demarkation
of the data, hardware and software. I traded silicon for synapses, and
today, as a Cognitive Scientist at the Centre for Consciousness Studies (NIMHANS),
my work revolves around multiple states of Consciousness across illness and
wellness in wake, sleeping, meditating and dreaming brains.

I am establishing a research niche on "Sense of Self" exploring how it emerges,
fragments, and can be altered in various states like Schizophrenia, Autism, 
Depression, Lucid dreaming, altered states in meditation etc. This work integrates
neuroscience, psychiatry, technology, and contemplative science to understand 
the shifts of selfhood and their impact on mental health.

> The Quiet Mind: Contemplative Science & Non-Linear Dynamics

During my MPhil research at NIMHANS and subsequent collaborations, I moved
beyond conventional EEG analysis to understand the "texture" of a meditating mind.
Standard EEG analysis often misses the nuance of meditative states. 
I applied non-linear methods like `Permutation Entropy and Fractal Dimension`
to high-density EEG data to capture these inherent structures.

More recently, we deployed ML based appraoches to understand how different 
meditation techniques lead to "Similar States but Different Paths"

> The Sleeping Brain: Stability, Spindles, and Sound

My time as a Junior Research Fellow at the Human Sleep Research Laboratory was
dedicated to understand the micro-architecture of sleep in Vipassana meditators
and healthy controls. I conducted over 125 whole-night polysomnography (PSG) 
studies, using auditory stimulation and transcranial Alternating Current
Stimulation (tACS) to "shake" the sleep architecture and test its stability.
We identified that sleep ERPs and tACS-induced spectral changes could serve
as reliable markers for sleep stability. More recently, I have prototyped
MVPA pipelines to decode dream states from sleep data using machine learning
classifiers.

I am currently exploring how microstate dynamics shift during sleep in both 
healthy brains and those affected by Schizophrenia. My work also includes 
developing machine learning classifiers to decode dream states from high-density
PSG data using serial awakening protocols. I am also developing automated
pipelines to capture sleep stage transitions and conceptualising sleep and awake
across a continuum and deploying information theory and similar metrics to
characterise sleep better.

> Can we enhance our cognitive skills: Cognition & Neuromodulation

My PhD work focused on the "executive" of the brain: Working Memory.
I wanted to know if we could map its limits and then push them using transcranial
alternating current protocols. I designed a real-time adaptive working memory
paradigm paired with high-density EEG to study the brain at its optimal capacity
rather than at rest. Using tACS, I demonstrated that we could differentially 
modulate resting and task-related EEG data. By targeting specific frequencies
(Theta and Gamma), we could influence the oscillatory dynamics underlying working
memory. A significant portion of this work involved studying patients with
Schizophrenia, using graph theory to identify specific profiles for targeted 
non-invasive neuromodulation.

> The Cardiac Signature: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Heart-Brain Interaction

I am exploring Heart-Brain Connection using computational models of brain-heart
interactions, and utilising robust and geometric versions of HRV analysis.

> Teaching and Mentoring: Building the Lab

Science is rarely a solo endeavor. I have had the privilege of mentoring over
25 trainees and interns at NIMHANS, guiding them from modularised project ideas
to full execution. Our collaborative projects have explored inter-brain synchrony
during musical engagement , Heart Evoked Potentials across sleep stages, and 
the association between personality traits and executive control in school children.
I collaborated with a bunch of hardware and software engineers to extend wireless
wearable EEG devices with single-board computers for real-time neurofeedback and
seizure prediction.
