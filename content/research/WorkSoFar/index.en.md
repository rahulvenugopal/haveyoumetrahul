### From Circuits to Consciousness

Welcome to my journey so far from the world of electronics and communication
engineering to Consciousness research. 

I began my career designing logic on circuit boards, only to realise the most
complex operating system runs on wetware where there is no clear demarkation
of the data, hardware and software. I traded silicon for synapses, and
today, as a Cognitive Scientist at the Centre for Consciousness Studies (NIMHANS),
my work revolves around multiple states of Consciousness across illness and
wellness in waking, sleeping, tasking, meditating and dreaming brains.

I am establishing a research niche on "Sense of Self" exploring how it emerges,
fragments, and can be altered in various states like Schizophrenia, Autism, 
Depression, Lucid dreaming, altered states in meditation etc. This work integrates
neuroscience, psychiatry, technology, and contemplative science to understand 
the shifts of selfhood and their impact on mental health.

> The Quiet Mind: Contemplative Science & Non-Linear Dynamics

During my MPhil research at NIMHANS and subsequent collaborations, I moved
beyond conventional EEG analysis to understand the "texture" of a meditating mind.
Standard analytsis appraoches often misses the nuance of multiple meditative states in
[Vipassana meditation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301051118301728).
I applied non-linear methods like `Permutation Entropy and
Fractal Dimension` to high-density EEG data to capture these inherent structures.

More recently, we deployed ML based appraoches to understand how different 
meditation techniques lead to [Similar States but Different Paths](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.20.660652v1.abstract).
We at CCS are pushing the boundaries of meditation research. You can read the recent
[paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425005214#ab0015) from 
Matthew Sacchet's group if you are interested in this area of work.

> The Sleeping Brain: Stability, Spindles, and Sound

My time as a Junior Research Fellow at the Human Sleep Research Laboratory was
dedicated to understand the micro-architecture of sleep in Vipassana meditators
and healthy controls. I conducted over 125 whole-night polysomnography (PSG) 
studies, using auditory stimulation and transcranial Alternating Current
Stimulation (tACS) to "shake" the sleep architecture and test its stability.
We identified that sleep ERPs and tACS-induced spectral changes could serve
as reliable markers for [sleep stability](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ner.12847). More recently, I have prototyped
MVPA pipelines to decode dream states from sleep data using machine learning
classifiers.

We also explored how microstate dynamics shift during sleep in both 
healthy brains and those affected by Schizophrenia. My work also includes 
developing machine learning classifiers to decode dream states from high-density
PSG data using serial awakening protocols. We also developed pipelines to capture sleep stage transitions and conceptualising sleep and awake
across a continuum and deploying information theory and similar metrics to
characterise sleep better. Our centre also hosts advanced training in sleep research
with Indian Society for Sleep Research. You can read these two papers [1](https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236%2824%2900018-3#f0005)
[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763423004347) to
know more about the field.

Recent works (PhD projects) has moved to developing real time protocols to modulate
sleep spindles during sleep with oscillatory pink noise.

> Can we enhance our cognitive skills: Cognition & Neuromodulation

My PhD work focused on the "executive" of the brain: Working Memory.
I wanted to know if we could map its limits and then push them using transcranial
alternating current protocols. I designed a real-time adaptive working memory
paradigm paired with high-density EEG to study the brain at its optimal capacity
rather than at rest. Using tACS, I demonstrated that we could [differentially 
modulate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094715924006731) resting and task-related EEG data. By targeting specific frequencies
(Theta and Gamma), we could influence the oscillatory dynamics underlying working
memory. A significant portion of this work involved studying patients with
Schizophrenia, using graph theory to identify specific profiles for targeted 
non-invasive neuromodulation.

> The Cardiac Signature: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Heart-Brain Interaction

We are exploring Heart-Brain interactions using computational models of brain-heart
interactions, and utilising robust and geometric versions of HRV analysis. We
applied [ultra short term heart rate variablity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0954611126000223) to understand OSA brains.

This is an active area of work at our centre. The goal is to model and understand
the three way interaction across nervous, cardiac and respiratory systems and how
does respiratory/cardiac/neural phases modulate/influence behavior and mental states.
I really got inspired by the works like [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051123001606),
and [this](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922006632/).

> Teaching and Mentoring: Building the Lab

Science is rarely a solo endeavor. I have had the privilege of mentoring over
25 trainees and interns at NIMHANS, guiding them from modularised project ideas
to full execution. Our collaborative projects have explored inter-brain synchrony
during musical engagement , Heart Evoked Potentials across sleep stages, and 
the association between personality traits and executive control in school children.
I collaborated with a bunch of hardware and software engineers to extend wireless
wearable EEG devices with single-board computers for real-time neurofeedback and
seizure prediction.

> What's cooking now?

a) We are working on applying 10 (ML an DL) models to a large chunk (26,000 subjects+)
of data to predict brain age index (chronological age minus brain age). One of the
goals is to come up with a cool paper (code and cookbook) in the domain of brain
age.

b) By undersatnding how the brain responds to the heart's rhythmic signals,
we can unlock new insights into interoception, cognitive load, and consciousness.
Does the Heart Race with the Mind when we do a tough mental task? The brain doesn't
stop listening to the heart when we fall asleep. How do sleep stages modulate
these HEPs? Can we track meditative depth with HEPs?
What is being captured by HEPs? Lot more in this direction
